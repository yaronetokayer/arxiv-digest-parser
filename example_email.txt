Title: Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering
Authors: Borui Zhang, Wei-Xiang Feng, Haipeng An
Categories: astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA gr-qc hep-ph
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, plus supplemental material (2 figures)
\\
  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of
compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little
red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of
$10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a
mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed
through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo
sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic
microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway
mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski
coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting
stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this
process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to
the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain
the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active
galactic nuclei.

Title: Ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power
  spectrum
Authors: Yanhui Yang, Simeon Bird, Ming-Feng Ho, and Mahdi Qezlou
Categories: astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM

\\
  We present GokuNEmu, a ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the
nonlinear matter power spectrum, designed to support next-generation
cosmological analyses. Built on the Goku $N$-body simulation suite and the
T2N-MusE emulation framework, GokuNEmu predicts the matter power spectrum with
$\sim 0.5 \%$ average accuracy for redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 3$ and scales
$0.006 \leq k/(h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) \leq 10$. The emulator models a 10D
parameter space that extends beyond $\Lambda$CDM to include dynamical dark
energy (characterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$), massive neutrinos ($\sum m_\nu$),
the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and running of the spectral
index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Its broad parameter coverage, particularly for the
extensions, makes it the only matter power spectrum emulator capable of testing
recent dynamical dark energy constraints from DESI. In addition, it requires
only $\sim $2 milliseconds to predict a single cosmology on a laptop, orders of
magnitude faster than existing emulators. These features make GokuNEmu a
uniquely powerful tool for interpreting observational data from upcoming
surveys such as LSST, Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope, and CSST.

Title: Design and optimization of neural networks for multifidelity
  cosmological emulation
Authors: Yanhui Yang, Simeon Bird, Ming-Feng Ho, and Mahdi Qezlou
Categories: astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM
Comments: 14 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables. Submitted to Physical Review
\\
  Accurate and efficient simulation-based emulators are essential for
interpreting cosmological survey data down to nonlinear scales. Multifidelity
emulation techniques reduce simulation costs by combining high- and
low-fidelity data, but traditional regression methods such as Gaussian
processes struggle with scalability in sample size and dimensionality. In this
work, we present T2N-MusE, a neural network framework characterized by (i) a
novel 2-step multifidelity architecture, (ii) a 2-stage Bayesian hyperparameter
optimization, (iii) a 2-phase $k$-fold training strategy, and (iv) a per-$z$
principal component analysis strategy. We apply T2N-MusE to selected data from
the Goku simulation suite, covering a 10-dimensional cosmological parameter
space, and build emulators for the matter power spectrum over a range of
redshifts with different configurations. We find the emulators outperform our
earlier Gaussian process models significantly and demonstrate that each of
these techniques is efficient in training neural networks or/and effective in
improving generalization accuracy. We observe a reduction in validation error
by more than a factor of five compared to previous work. This framework has
been used to build the most powerful emulator for the matter power spectrum,
GokuNEmu, and will also be used to construct emulators for other statistics in
future.

Title: Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2
Authors: Swagat S. Mishra, William L. Matthewson, Varun Sahni, Arman Shafieloo
  and Yuri Shtanov
Categories: astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph hep-th
Comments: Main text - 21 pages and 16 figures (additional details in
  appendices)
\\
  Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with
the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favor a scenario in which dark energy (DE)
decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state
(EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w < - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w > - 1$
at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$.
Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories
such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In
this work, we investigate a class of thawing scalar field models propagating on
a (4+1)-dimensional phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective
EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS
of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the Om diagnostic, and demonstrate that
the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI
DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$
values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL
parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.

  These notes are very much work-in-progress and simply intended to showcase,
in various degrees of details (and rigour), some of the cosmology calculations
that class_sz can do. We describe the class_sz code in C, Python and Jax. Based
on the Boltzmann code class, it can compute a wide range of observables
relevant to current and forthcoming CMB and Large Scale Structure surveys. This
includes galaxy shear and clustering, CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev
and Zeldovich observables, Cosmic Infrared Background, cross-correlations and
three-point statistics. Calculations can be done either within the halo model
or the linear bias model. For standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions,
class_sz uses high-accuracy cosmopower emulators of the CMB and matter power
spectrum to accelerate calculations. With this, along with efficient numerical
integration routines, most class_sz output can be obtained in less than 500 ms
(CMB $C_\ell$'s or matter $P(k)$ take $\mathcal{O}(1\mathrm{ms})$), allowing
for fast or ultra-fast parameter inference analyses. Parts of the calculations
are "jaxified", so the software can be integrated into differentiable
pipelines.

Title: The z=1.03 Merging Cluster SPT-CL J0356-5337: New Strong Lensing

  We present a strong lensing analysis and reconstruct the mass distribution of
SPT-CL J0356-5337, a galaxy cluster at redshift z = 1.034. Our model supersedes
previous models by making use of new multi-band HST data and MUSE spectroscopy.
We identify two additional lensed galaxies to inform a more well-constrained
model using 12 sets of multiple images in 5 separate lensed sources. The three
previously-known sources were spectroscopically confirmed by Mahler et al.
(2020) at redshifts of z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048. We measured the
spectroscopic redshifts of two of the newly-discovered arcs using MUSE data, at
z = 3.0205 and z = 5.3288. We increase the number of cluster member galaxies by
a factor of three compared to previous work. We also report the detection of
extended Lya emission from several background galaxies. We measure the total
projected mass density of the two major sub-cluster components, one dominated
by the BCG, and the other by a compact group of luminous red galaxies. We find
M_BCG(< 80kpc) = 3.93+0.21-0.14 * 10^13Msun and M_LRG(< 80kpc) = 2.92+0.16
-0.23 * 10^13Msun, yielding a mass ratio of 1.35+0.16 -0.08. The strong lensing
constraints offer a robust estimate of the projected mass density regardless of
modelling assumptions; allowing more substructure in this line of sight does
not change the results or conclusions. Our results corroborate the conclusion
that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is dominated by two mass components, and is likely
undergoing a major merger on the plane of the sky

  The Euclid space telescope of the European Space Agency (ESA) is designed to
provide sensitive and accurate measurements of weak gravitational lensing
distortions over wide areas on the sky. Here we present a weak gravitational
lensing analysis of early Euclid observations obtained for the field around the
massive galaxy cluster Abell 2390 as part of the Euclid Early Release
Observations programme. We conduct galaxy shape measurements using three
independent algorithms (LensMC, KSB+, and SourceXtractor++). Incorporating
multi-band photometry from Euclid and Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we estimate
photometric redshifts to preferentially select background sources from
tomographic redshift bins, for which we calibrate the redshift distributions
using the self-organising map approach and data from the Cosmic Evolution
Survey (COSMOS). We quantify the residual cluster member contamination and
correct for it in bins of photometric redshift and magnitude using their source
density profiles, including corrections for source obscuration and
magnification. We reconstruct the cluster mass distribution and jointly fit the
tangential reduced shear profiles of the different tomographic bins with
spherical Navarro--Frenk--White profile predictions to constrain the cluster
mass, finding consistent results for the three shape catalogues and good
agreement with earlier measurements. As an important validation test we compare
these joint constraints to mass measurements obtained individually for the
different tomographic bins, finding good consistency. More detailed constraints
on the cluster properties are presented in a companion paper that additionally
incorporates strong lensing measurements. Our analysis provides a first
demonstration of the outstanding capabilities of Euclid for tomographic weak
lensing measurements.

Title: Whispers from the Early Universe: The Ringdown of Primordial Black Holes
Authors: Chen Yuan, Zhen Zhong, and Qing-Guo Huang
Categories: astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-th
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated
by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early
universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism,
the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically
compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that
such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs
heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH
mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of
next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and
Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing
the PBH dark matter scenario.

Title: Exploring non-cold dark matter in a scenario of dynamical dark energy
  with DESI DR2 data
Authors: Tian-Nuo Li, Peng-Ju Wu, Guo-Hong Du, Yan-Hong Yao, Jing-Fei Zhang,
  Xin Zhang
Categories: astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but
have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE)
may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of
a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform
analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI
DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia
supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of
CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS
parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a
constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$
and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$.
Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and
$w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and
Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model
relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a
non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.

Title: Fisher Score Matching for Simulation-Based Forecasting and Inference
Authors: Ce Sui, Shivam Pandey, Benjamin D. Wandelt
Categories: astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM
Comments: Accepted to the 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics.
  Code available at: https://github.com/suicee/FisherScoreMatching
\\
  We propose a method for estimating the Fisher score--the gradient of the
log-likelihood with respect to model parameters--using score matching. By
introducing a latent parameter model, we show that the Fisher score can be
learned by training a neural network to predict latent scores via a mean
squared error loss. We validate our approach on a toy linear Gaussian model and
a cosmological example using a differentiable simulator. In both cases, the
learned scores closely match ground truth for plausible data-parameter pairs.
This method extends the ability to perform Fisher forecasts, and gradient-based
Bayesian inference to simulation models, even when they are not differentiable;
it therefore has broad potential for advancing cosmological analyses.

Title: Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with tensor-scalar induced

  Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current
cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations
remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order tensor-scalar induced
gravitational waves (TSIGWs) generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and
tensor perturbations on small scales. We provide the analytical expressions for
the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of
second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of SGWB across different scales,
TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations
and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of
TSIGWs dominating the current PTA observations under various primordial power
spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic
primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA
observations.

Title: Baryonification: An alternative to hydrodynamical simulations for

\\
  We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies
dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for
gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach
first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic
components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By
applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and
temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against
hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature
varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density
and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we
calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from
the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify
$N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum
suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out
this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2
percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We
also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for
feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The
2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than
2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys.
Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body
simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual
inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the
integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to
quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.

Title: A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule
  Perturbations on Orbital Motion
Authors: Yu Zhao, Andrew Benson, Xiaolong Du
Categories: astro-ph.CO
Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS
\\
  In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight
axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark
matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of
subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these
effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion
approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the
perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be
applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to
finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos
behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed
perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using
FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule
accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.

Title: Constraints from CMB lensing tomography with projected bispectra
Authors: Lea Harscouet, David Alonso, Andrina Nicola, An\v{z}e Slosar
Categories: astro-ph.CO
Comments: 27 pages, 12 figures
\\
  We measure the angular power spectrum and bispectrum of the projected
overdensity of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies, and its
cross-correlation with maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background lensing
convergence from \planck. This analysis is enabled by the use of the
``filtered-squared bispectrum'' approach, introduced in previous work, which we
generalise here to the case of cross-correlations between multiple fields. The
projected galaxy bispectrum is detected at very high significance (above
$30\sigma$ in all redshift bins), and the galaxy-galaxy-convergence bispectrum
is detected above $5\sigma$ in the three highest-redshift bins. We find that
the bispectrum is reasonably well described over a broad range of scales by a
tree-level prediction using the linear galaxy bias measured from the power
spectrum. We carry out the first cosmological analysis combining projected
power spectra and bispectra under a relatively simple model, and show that the
galaxy bispectrum can be used in combination with the power spectrum to place a
constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, an on the
non-relativistic matter fraction $\Omega_m$. We find that data combinations
involving the galaxy bispectrum recover constraints on these parameters that
are in good agreement with those found from the traditional
``2$\times$2-point'' combination of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-convergence power
spectra, across all redshift bins.

  Baryonic feedback alters the matter distribution on small and intermediate
scales, posing a challenge for precision cosmology. The new, component-wise
baryonification (BFC) approach provides a self-consistent framework to model
feedback effects for different observables. In this paper we use this framework
to fit kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) observations from the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT) alongside halo X-ray gas fractions from eROSITA,
investigating baryonic feedback in a cosmological context. We first show that
the kSZ data from ACT is consistent with the gas fractions from eROSITA, both
suggesting a feedback model that is stronger than what is assumed in most
hydrodynamical simulations. This finding is in contrast to older, pre-eROSITA
gas fraction measurements that point towards weaker feedback in tension with
the kSZ results. We suspect these discrepancies to be due to selection bias in
the pre-eROSITA sample, or differences in halo mass estimation between the two
data sets. In a further step, we use the BFC model to predict the baryonic
suppression of the matter power spectrum. Based on our combined fit to data
from ACT and eROSITA, we find a power spectrum suppression that exceeds the
percent-level at modes above $k=0.3-0.6 \,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, growing to 2-8
percent at $k=1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and to 20-25 percent at
$k=5\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, consistent with strong-feedback hydrodynamical
simulations. Finally, we compare our best-fitting model to the observed gas
density and pressure profiles of massive galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample,
finding excellent agreement. These results show that BFC provides a
self-consistent picture of feedback across mass- and length scales as well as
different cosmological observables, thus making it promising for applications
to multiwavelength studies to jointly constrain cosmology and baryonic effects.

indicative of strong gas outflows in the neutral phase. However, the measured
mass outflow rates are highly uncertain because JWST observations can only
probe the column density of trace elements such as sodium, while most of the
gas is in the form of hydrogen. The conversion between the column density of
sodium and that of hydrogen is based on observations of gas clouds within the
Milky Way, and has not been directly tested for massive galaxies at high
redshift. In order to test this conversion, we study a unique system consisting
of a massive quiescent galaxy (J1439B) at z = 2.4189 located at a projected
distance of 38 physical kpc from the bright background quasar QSO J1439. The
neutral outflow from the galaxy is observed as a sub-damped Lyman-alpha
absorber in the spectrum of the background quasar, which enables a direct
measurement of the hydrogen column density from Lyman transitions. We obtain
new near-infrared spectroscopy with Magellan/FIRE and detect Na I D and other
resonant absorption lines from Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. We are thus able to
derive new, empirical calibrations between the column density of trace elements
and the hydrogen column density, that can be used to estimate the mass and the
rate of neutral gas outflows in other massive quiescent galaxies at high
redshift. The calibration we derive for Na I is only 30% lower than the local
relation that is typically assumed at high redshift, confirming that the
neutral outflows observed with JWST at z > 2 are able to remove a large amount
of gas and are thus likely to play a key role in galaxy quenching. However,
using the local calibration for Mg II yields an order-of-magnitude discrepancy
compared to the empirical calibration, possibly because of variations in the
dust depletion.

Title: Correlations between Dust Extinction Features across All Wavelength
  Scales: From Diffuse Interstellar Bands to R(V)
Authors: Andrew K. Saydjari and Gregory M. Green

  Understanding variations in the dust extinction curve is imperative for using
dust as a tracer of local structure in the interstellar medium, understanding
dust chemistry, and observational color corrections where dust is a nuisance
parameter. However, the extinction curve is complicated and exhibits features
across a wide range of wavelength scales, from narrow atomic lines and diffuse
interstellar bands ("DIBs"), to intermediate-scale and very broad structures
("ISS" and "VBS"), and the overall slope of the optical extinction curve,
parameterized by R(V). Robust, population-level studies of variations in these
features are only now possible with large, all-sky, spectroscopic surveys.
However, these features are often studied independently because they require
drastically different spectral resolution. In this work, we couple features
with disparate wavelength scales by cross-matching precision catalogs of DIB
measurements from APOGEE and Gaia RVS with low-resolution extinction-curve
measurements from Gaia XP. Using this combination, we show that there are
meaningful correlations between the strengths of extinction-curve features
across all wavelength scales. We present a model that statistically explains
part of the excess scatter in DIB strength versus extinction, and we show
variation in line shapes of two DIBs as a function of R(V). We find that most
DIBs increase in strength with increasing R(V) and/or increasing strength of
the ISS, though we found one DIB that anomalously decreases in strength with
increasing R(V). Using the behavior of the ensemble of DIBs in APOGEE, we
present this as the first evidence of systematic chemical variation
accompanying R(V) variation.

Title: The Balmer Break and Optical Continuum of Little Red Dots From
  Super-Eddington Accretion
Authors: Hanpu Liu, Yan-Fei Jiang, Eliot Quataert, Jenny E. Greene, Yilun Ma
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 22 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome!
\\
  The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources
with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines--remains elusive. The
redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at
a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many
LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense
gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and
radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion
system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously,
without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The
break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit,
similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of
super-Eddington systems, $\rho<10^{-9}{\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant
opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$.
Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine
tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a
geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective
temperature $4000{\rm~K}\lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm~K}$ that is very
insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar
models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer
break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our
model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super-Eddington
accretion simulations.

  The polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission from aligned
non-spherical grains provides a powerful tool for tracing magnetic field
morphologies and strengths in diffuse interstellar medium to star-forming
regions, and constraining dust grain properties and their alignment mechanisms.
However, the physics of grain alignment is not yet fully understood. The
alignment based on RAdiative Torques (RATs), known as RAT Alignment or RAT-A
mechanism is the most acceptable mechanism. In this work, we investigate the
grain alignment mechanisms in F13 (F13N and F13C) and F13S filamentary regions
of the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarized thermal dust emission
observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu$m. We find that the polarization
fraction decreases with increasing total intensity and gas column density in
each region, termed as polarization hole. We investigate for any role of
magnetic field tangling on the observed polarization hole by estimating the
polarization angle dispersion function. Our study finds that the polarization
hole is not significantly influenced by magnetic field tangling, but majorly
due to decrease in RAT alignment efficiency of grains in denser regions. To
test whether RAT-A mechanism can reproduce the observational results, we
estimate minimum alignment size of grains using RAT theory. Our study finds
strong evidence for RAT-A mechanism that can explain the polarization hole. We
also find potential hints that the observed higher polarization fractions in
some regions of F13 filament can be due to combined effects of both
suprathermal rotation by RATs and enhanced magnetic relaxation, supporting the
Magnetically-Enhanced RAT (M-RAT) mechanism.

  The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to
curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member
stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM
survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has
established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to
constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster
sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other
large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate
considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial
[Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's
current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$
dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not
find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element
gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have
sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In
this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial
abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.

Title: Orientation of galaxy spins relative to filaments of the large-scale
  structure of the Universe
Authors: A. V. Antipova, D. I. Makarov, N. Libeskind and E. Tempel
Categories: astro-ph.GA
\\
  The theory of galaxy formation posits a clear correlation between the spin of
galaxies and the orientation of the elements of the large-scale structure of
the Universe, particularly cosmic filaments. A substantial number of
observational and modelling studies have been undertaken with the aim of
identifying the dependence of spin orientation on the components of the
large-scale structure. However, the findings of these studies remain
contradictory. In this paper, we present an analysis of the orientation of the
spins of 2 861 galaxies with respect to the filaments of the large-scale
structure of the Universe. All galaxies in our sample have an inclination to
the line of sight greater than 85 degrees, enabling an unambiguous
determination of the spin axis direction in space. We investigate the alignment
of galaxy spin axes relative to cosmic web filaments as a function of various
properties for galaxies. Our results reveal a statistically significant
tendency for the galaxy spin axes to align along the filament axes of the
large-scale structure.

  We present a multi-band study of the diffuse emission in the galaxy cluster
Abell 3558, located in the core of the Shapley Supercluster. Using new MeerKAT
UHF-Band and uGMRT Band-3 observations, and published MeerKAT L-band and ASKAP
887 MHz data, we perform a detailed analysis of the diffuse emission in the
cluster centre. We complement with XMM-Newton X-ray information for a thorough
study of the connection between the thermal and non-thermal properties of the
cluster. We find that the diffuse radio emission in the cluster centre is more
extended than published earlier, with a previously undetected extension
spanning 100 kpc towards the north beyond the innermost cold front, increasing
the total size of the emission to 550 kpc, and shows a clear spatial
correlation with the X-ray features. The overall radio spectrum is steep
($\alpha_{\rm 400\,MHz}^{\rm 1569\,MHz}=1.18\pm0.10$), with local fluctuations
which show several connections with the X-ray surface brightness, cold fronts,
and residual emission. The point-to-point correlation between the radio and
X-ray surface brightness is sub-linear, and steepens with increasing frequency.
We discuss the classification of the diffuse emission considering its overall
properties, those of the ICM, and the existing scaling laws between the radio
and X-ray quantities in galaxy clusters. We conclude that it is a mini-halo,
powered by turbulent (re)-acceleration induced by sloshing motions within the
cluster region delimited by the cold fronts, and it supports the picture of a
known minor merger between A\,3558 and the group SC\,1327--312 with mass ratio
5:1.

  The ring structures of disk galaxies are vital for understanding galaxy
evolution and dynamics. However, due to the scarcity of ringed galaxies and
challenges in their identification, traditional methods often struggle to
efficiently obtain statistically significant samples. To address this, this
study employs a novel semi-supervised deep learning model, GC-SWGAN, aimed at
identifying galaxy rings from high-resolution images of the DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys. We selected over 5,000 confirmed ringed galaxies from the Catalog of
Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) and the Northern Ringed Galaxies from the GZ2
catalog (GZ2-CNRG), both verified by morphology expert R. J. Buta, to create an
annotated training set. Additionally, we incorporated strictly selected
non-ringed galaxy samples from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and utilized unlabelled
data from DESI Legacy Surveys to train our model. Through semi-supervised
learning, the model significantly reduced reliance on extensive annotated data
while enhancing robustness and generalization. On the test set, it demonstrated
exceptional performance in identifying ringed galaxies. With a probability
threshold of 0.5, the classification accuracy reached 97\%, with precision and
recall for ringed galaxies at 94\% and 93\%, respectively. Building on these
results, we predicted 750,000 galaxy images from the DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys with r-band apparent magnitudes less than 17.0 and redshifts in the
range 0.0005 < z < 0.25, compiling the largest catalog of ringed galaxies to
date, containing 62,962 galaxies with ring structures. This catalog provides
essential data for subsequent research on the formation mechanisms and
evolutionary history of galaxy rings.

  High-velocity stars are interesting targets to unveil the formation of the
Milky Way. In fact they can be recently accreted from an infalling dwarf
galaxies or they can be the result of a turbulent merging of galaxies. Gaia is
providing the community a way to select stars for their kinematics and the
radial velocity, one of the speed components, is derived from the Gaia RVS
spectrum. High absolute radial velocity values are sensitive to be false
positive. They are rare and as such they are more easily impacted than lower
velocity stars, by contamination by very low SNR spurious measures. We here
investigate a sample of 26 stars with Gaia absolute radial velocity in excess
of 500___km/s with spectroscopic follow-up observations with UVES. For all but
one star the extreme radial velocity is confirmed and these stars are all
metal-poor and, as expected, enhanced in the elements. The complete chemical
inventory confirm the large star-to-star scatter for the heavy elements and
their on average larger ratio over iron with respect to the Sun, in agreement
with the literature.

Title: Magnetic fields and cosmic rays in M31. II. Strength and distribution of
  the magnetic field components
Authors: Rainer Beck and Elly M. Berkhuijsen
Categories: astro-ph.GA
\\
  The intensities of total, linearly polarized, and unpolarized synchrotron
emission are measures for the strengths of total, ordered, and isotropic
turbulent fields in the sky plane. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) provide a
model of the regular field. The quadratic difference between ordered and
regular field strengths yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field.
- Based on observations of M31 at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20.5 cm wavelengths and
assuming equipartition between the energy densities of total magnetic fields
and total cosmic rays, we measured average equipartition strengths of the
magnetic field in the emission torus of M31 of 6.3\pm\0.2 \muG for the total,
5.4\pm0.2 \muG for the isotropic turbulent, and 3.2\pm0.3 \muG for the ordered
field in the sky plane. The average strength of the axisymmetric regular field,
Breg, is 2.0\pm0.5 \muG and remains almost constant between 7 kpc and 12 kpc
radius. Quadratic subtraction of the component Breg,perp in the sky plane from
the ordered field Bord,perp yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent
field Ban,perp, which is 2.7\pm0.7 \muG. - The average strength of the regular
field is about 40% smaller than the equipartition strength of the ordered
field, which is consistent with the assumption of equipartition. The almost
constant ratio between regular and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.39 is
consistent with present-day dynamo models. The almost constant ratio between
anisotropic and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.57 indicates that
anisotropic turbulent fields are generated by the shearing of isotropic
turbulent fields. - The average magnetic energy density is about five times
larger than the thermal energy density of the diffuse warm ionized gas, while
the magnetic energy density is similar to the kinetic energy density of
turbulent motions of the neutral gas.

Title: Why Jet Power and Star Formation Are Uncorrelated in Active Galaxies
Authors: David Garofalo, Brent McDaniel, Max North
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE
Comments: Published
Journal-ref: Galaxies, 2025
\\
  Jet luminosity from active galaxies and the rate of star formation have
recently been found to be uncorrelated observationally. We show how to
understand this in the context of a model in which powerful AGN jets enhance
star formation for up to hundreds of millions of years while jet power
decreases in time, followed by a longer phase in which star formation is
suppressed but coupled to jet power increasing with time. We also highlight
characteristic differences depending on environment richness in a way that is
also compatible with the observed SEDs of high redshift radio galaxies. While
the absence of a direct correlation between jet power and star formation rate
emerges naturally, our framework allows us to also predict the environment
richness, range of excitation and redshift values of radio AGN in the jet
power-star formation rate plane.

  Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect
on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the
photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been
demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of
molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced
photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing
perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as
an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous
grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these
carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects.
We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the
effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of
PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from
the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous
studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to
CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We
demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to
efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order
of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to
those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid
water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR
excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could
potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such
as CO from icy grains.

Title: On the statistical nature of Betti numbers and Euler characteristic of
  smooth random fields
Authors: Pravabati Chingangbam
Categories: math.ST astro-ph.CO math-ph math.MP math.PR stat.TH
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  We represent excursion sets of smooth random fields as unions of a
topological basis consisting of a sequence of simply and multiply connected
compact subsets of the underlying manifold. The associated coefficients, which
are non-negative discrete random variables, reflect the randomness of the
field. Betti numbers of the excursion sets can be expressed as summations over
the coefficients, and the Euler characteristic and the sum of Betti numbers can
also be expressed as their (alternating) sum. This enables understanding their
statistical properties as sums (or differences) of discrete random variables.
We examine the conditions under which each topological statistic can be
asymptotically Gaussian as the size of the manifold and the resolution
increase. The coefficients of the basis elements are then modeled as Binomial
variables, and the statistical natures of Betti numbers, Euler character and
sum of Betti numbers follow from this fundamental property. We test the
validity of the modeling using numerical calculations, and identify threshold
regimes where the topological statistics can be approximated as Gaussian
variables. The new representation of excursion sets thus maps the properties of
topological statistics to combinatorial structures, thereby providing
mathematical clarity on their use for physical inference, particularly in
cosmology.

  We evaluate 9 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent configurations on
105 Cosmology Question-Answer (QA) pairs that we built specifically for this
purpose.The RAG configurations are manually evaluated by a human expert, that
is, a total of 945 generated answers were assessed. We find that currently the
best RAG agent configuration is with OpenAI embedding and generative model,
yielding 91.4\% accuracy. Using our human evaluation results we calibrate
LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ) system which can be used as a robust proxy for human
evaluation. These results allow us to systematically select the best RAG agent
configuration for multi-agent system for autonomous scientific discovery in
astrophysics (e.g., cmbagent presented in a companion paper) and provide us
with an LLMaaJ system that can be scaled to thousands of cosmology QA pairs. We
make our QA dataset, human evaluation results, RAG pipelines, and LLMaaJ system
publicly available for further use by the astrophysics community.

Title: 20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and
  implications for dark matter annihilation
Authors: Tomonori Totani
Categories: astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO hep-ph
Comments: 30 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region
of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter
annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60$ deg,
$10 \le |b| \le 60$ deg) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of
cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the
Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further
examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp
peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and
above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a
spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile
agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly
shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic
uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In
particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative
to the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other
model templates. The halo excess can be fitted by the annihilation spectrum
with a mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and annihilation cross section $\langle
\sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for
the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from
dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various
uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter
interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for
verification through future observations are briefly discussed.

Title: Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact
  binary population
Authors: Amanda Farah, Jose Mar\'ia Ezquiaga, Maya Fishbach, Daniel Holz
Categories: astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO gr-qc
Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures. Code release:
  https://github.com/afarah18/GW-lensing-outliers-public
\\
  All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by
intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a
gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it appears to have originated from a
closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave
source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed
events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population
outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed,
nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers.
This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on
observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because
lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources,
which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier
implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We
additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical
depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or
absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest
gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on
the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or
more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs
will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the
optical depth. Future work will investigate the ability of the full inferred
population of compact binaries to inform the distribution of lenses in the
Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and
constrain cosmic structures.

Title: Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers from Young and Old Dense
  Star Clusters

\\
  Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger
rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic
dense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger
rate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in
these environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably
old globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses
$M_p\approx30\,M_{\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower
redshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce
lower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of
primary mass, from about $6\,M_{\odot}$ to above $100\,M_{\odot}$, with a peak
near $8\,M_{\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred
from gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH
mergers (about $95\%$ with $M_p\lesssim 20\,M_{\odot}$) originate in metal-rich
($Z \sim Z_{\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form
predominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of
hierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave
detection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially
identifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as
probes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low
redshifts.

  The blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501) was observed on three occasions over a
4-month period between 2022 March and 2022 July with the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this paper, we report for the first time on the
third IXPE observation, performed between 2022 July 9 and 12, during which IXPE
detected a linear polarization degree of $\Pi_X=6\pm2$ per cent at a
polarization angle, measured east of north, of $\Psi_X=143^\circ\pm11^\circ$
within the 2-8 keV X-ray band. The X-ray polarization angle and degree during
this observation are consistent with those obtained during the first two
observations. The chromaticity of the polarization across radio, optical, and
X-ray bands is likewise consistent with the result from the simultaneous
campaigns during the first two observations. Furthermore, we present two types
of models to explain the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
energy-resolved polarization: a synchrotron self-Compton model with an
anisotropic magnetic field probability distribution in the emitting volume, as
well as an energy-stratified shock model. Our results support both the shock
scenario as well as support that small levels of magnetic field anisotropy can
explain the observed polarization.

  Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition
offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution,
broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and
constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize
the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet
C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a
medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very
Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data
reduction and flux calibration were applied. It corresponds to a spectral slope
at least a factor of $\sim1.86$ higher than that of 2I/Borisov. Although the
object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH
and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$
s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those
of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.

  We have investigated the lensing event KMT-2024-BLG-0404. The light curve of
the event exhibited a complex structure with multiple distinct features,
including two prominent caustic spikes, two cusp bumps, and a brief
discontinuous feature between the caustic spikes. While a binary-lens model
captured the general anomaly pattern, it could not account for a discontinuous
anomaly feature between the two caustic spikes. To explore the origin of the
unexplained feature, we conducted more advanced modeling beyond the standard
binary-lens framework. This investigation demonstrated that the previously
unexplained anomaly was resolved by introducing an additional lens component
with planetary mass. The estimated masses of the lens components are $M_{\rm
p}= 17.3^{+25.5}_{-8.8}~M_{\rm E}$ for the planet, and $M_{\rm
h,A}=0.090^{+0.133}_{-0.046}~M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm
h,B}=0.026^{+0.038}_{-0.013}~M_\odot$ for the binary host stars. Based on these
mass estimates, the lens system is identified as a planetary system where a
Uranus-mass planet orbits a binary consisting of a late M dwarf and a brown
dwarf. The distance to the planetary system is estimated to be $D_{\rm L} =
7.21^{+0.93}_{-0.97}$~kpc, with an 82\% probability that it resides in the
Galactic bulge. This discovery represents the ninth planetary system found
through microlensing with a planet orbiting a binary host. Notably, it is the
first case where the host consists of both a star and a brown dwarf.

  We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein
Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks.
Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT,
the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the
northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier
results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of
temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV
of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with
high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results
support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven
by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well
with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.

Title: Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger
  Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process
Authors: Mengye Wang, Qingwen Wu and Yiqiu Ma
Categories: astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA
Comments: 13pages, 8 figures, Submitted to ApJ
\\
  Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single
interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential
source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities.
Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can
significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such
as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct
estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In
this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of
1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian
\emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance
the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system
and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects
together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as
high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in
encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the
enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger
radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed
within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the
BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a
timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures
of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.
